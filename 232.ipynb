        "In the web development world, there are main three tribes: infrastructure, back-end, and front-end. Database and infrastructure tribe is closely related to the back-end one. This tribe ensures that the whole serving part is working properly and is available to reach 24/7. The Front-end tribe is working on the UI and UX of the application. The tribe is creating interfaces (websites, applications even chatbots) that users are using every day. Their main task is to ensure information representation and collection. And then there is a back-end tribe. Back-enders are the missing puzzle part between servers and clients. This tribe works on creating bridges of information between database and user interface. The main tools of this tribe are some kind of back-end frameworks. To find more information about the differences read [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/front-end-vs-back-end) post."

        "In the world of back-end, there are two main categories of tools: frameworks and libraries. Many different languages have many different tools: Php has Symphony and Laravel, C# has .NET, Python has Django and Flask. One of the best skills a developer can have is to select the right tool for the right job. You would not choose an excavator to dig a simple hole in the garden, right? So, as a developer, you also need to make wise choices when solving technical problems. One tool can be easy to set-up and use but hard to scale, another can be an overkill for simple API but be an outstanding choice for building complex applications. So, what choices do you have as a Python developer?"

To get a better understanding of this tool read [this](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/django-explained) blog post by IBM and later watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyP4Uw2b2XM) video that briefly explains Django functionality."

Where you really want to use Flask is a simple API creation. You can use one to serve your newly trained model using it. To get more familiar with this tool, read [this](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/flask) introduction to Flask post (you can skip connection to databases parts for now) and most importantly watch [freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) video that explains main concepts of Flask in less than an hour. Also, you should not ignore and read [the official documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/) that summarizes the whole quickstart process."
